# bob
Bob is an asynchronous HTTP/1.1 server written in C++, built on top of libuv to deliver high performance, non-blocking I/O, and low latency. It uses optimized memory buffers for efficient reading and writing, and is designed for applications that require fine-grained control over the network event loop without the overhead of heavy frameworks.
